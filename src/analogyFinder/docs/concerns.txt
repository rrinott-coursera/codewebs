Noted concerns:

Concern #1:
    If you have a program with repeated lines, and the line falls under an
    equivalence class, it will be reduced to one line:
    
    For example
        while(true):
          println(x)
          println(x)
      
    Would become
        while(true):
          {1}
          
    Instead of
        while(true):
          {1}
          {1}
