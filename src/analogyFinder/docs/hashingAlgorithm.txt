Each node has a hash code calculation based on its type, name etc. This
nodeHash is computed only once and saved by the node.

Since nodes are also trees, there is a treeHash associated with each node.
This is the hash of the node, hashed into the hash of the nodes children.

In general, our task is to calculate the hash of a subforest. The hash of the
forest is the hash of all the root hashes :)..

Now when we calculate the hash of a complement, sometimes not all of a nodes
children will be in that complement. Therefore, we can only use a nodes memoized
treeHash IF all of a nodes descendents are in the subtree we are looking at.
