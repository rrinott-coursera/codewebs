Make sure the Makefile points to your install of Octave.  You might need to update your /etc/ld.so.conf file, adding /usr/local/lib/octave/3.6.3 (or wherever your install is) to the end of the file.  If you do this, remember to run ldconfig right after.
To run after making, run
./astgen ../data/examplescripts/example1.m output.json output.code output.map

Nodes that don't have their own explicit parse tree nodes:
varargout (custom VARARGOUT node)
varargin (custom VARARGIN node)
string-based indexing (CONST node)

To compute a matching (output sent to standard out), run
./matching a.json b.json

To compute the LCA of two nodes, run
./lca output.json 19 21
